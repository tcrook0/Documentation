<!--
A NOTE ON THE MARKDOWN USED IN THIS DOCUMENT - ISSUE / WORKAROUND FOR SECTION LINKS

Most of the Markdown used in this document is fairly straightforward; however, there's an issue with Section Links, a work-around for which, was not found in the Markdown documentation. This issue is particularly acute if spaces and hypens are used.

For example, the section immediately below the Table of Contents:

Git and GitHub Bookmark Folders - An Outline

This section has both space and hypens in it; how is its section link found?

On the machine and browser used to write this on, hovering the mouse over the section text results in a display of an icon suggesting two links in a chain... This icon will appear to the very left of this text. A left-click on this icon displays a drop-down menu with a Copy Link option. Clicking on Copy Link and then pasting into, say, a simple text editor, will result in the following being displayed: 

https://github.com/tcrook0/Documentation/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20Git%20and%20GitHub%20-%20A%20Bookmark-Based%20Approach/Introduction%20to%20Git%20and%20GitHub%20-%20A%20Bookmark-Based%20Approach.md#git-and-github-bookmark-folders---an-outline

Part of the above text is needed to form the Section Link - the part that follows the hash sign:

git-and-github-bookmark-folders---an-outline

This is why the first Section Link listed immediately under the Table of Contents, below, is listed as:

[Git and GitHub Bookmark Folders - An Outline](#git-and-github-bookmark-folders---an-outline)

The steps used above to find:

git-and-github-bookmark-folders---an-outline

May be similarly used on all of the other sections to derive their Section Links accordingly also.

# In a Hurry?

[Getting Ready for Class]

The above link takes you to the start of the [GitHub Training Manual]. Go through it. Important: Follow the instructions to set up your GitHub account before proceeding through the rest of the [GitHub Training Manual].

# Overview

The advice in [Getting Ready for Class] is still a good idea; however, it might be helpful to look over the rest of this document. Doing so will help you to get a feel for what Git and GitHub are about.

One of many things not covered: [Downloading, Installation & Configuration]...

This document collects together an annotated set of bookmarks gathered in the course of grappling with Git, GitHub, and Java. Once you get past [Downloading, Installation & Configuration], you might want to next go through [Java Eclipse Project GitHub Repository Creation] which will take you through a series of steps using Git, GitHub, and Java to create a GitHub repository for a Java program.

In short, this document was written after just barely enough Git and GitHub knowledge was acquired to be dangerous...

[Java Eclipse Project GitHub Repository Creation]: (./Java%20Eclipse%20Project%20GitHub%20Repository%20Creation.md)

# Downloading, Installation & Configuration

This document refers to various pieces of software; unfortunately, it doesn't provide much guidance for getting Git, GitHub, let alone Java, downloaded, installed, and configured on your machine. To do that, follow the instructions in [Getting Ready for Class].

GitHub, in practice, is used with Git. This can be confusing. Don't worry! This document and [Java Eclipse Project GitHub Repository Creation] will help make some sense of that...

One thing to keep in mind is the importance of being able to distinguish between, and work with, local repositories on your machine in synchrony with their counterparts on GitHub.

Here are a few bookmarks referring to information you might want to keep in mind while you work on [Downloading, Installation & Configuration] as described in [Getting Ready for Class]:

- [Authentication - GitHub Docs]
- [Creating a personal access token - GitHub Docs]
- [Accessing GitHub using two-factor authentication - GitHub Docs]

# Git and GitHub Bookmark Folders - An Outline

The bookmarks referred to in this document are gathered together in a hierarchical set of bookmark folders, as supported by any web browser, as shown below:

- [Git]
- [GitHub]
  - [Docs]
  - [Training]
    - [Get started]
      - [Quickstart]
      - [Skills]
    - [YouTube]
  - [Writing]
    - [Markdown]

# Git and GitHub Bookmarks

The remainder of this document shows the bookmarks organized within the folders shown in [Git and GitHub Bookmark Folders - An Outline]. The description for each of these folders has its own section in this document, below. Each of these sections has a table showing both the bookmark name (Website column) and its associated Universal Resource Locator - URL (Address column).

Suggestion: create these folders and bookmarks for yourself and then look at them. Having a related set of bookmarks in separate tabs on your browser, and then looking at each of the resulting pages, in order, will give you an idea of relationship. It will also give you an idea of what's out there that may be of use.

Additional information regarding a related set of bookmarks may or may not follow after the its...
