# Description

Instructions on how to create a Java Eclipse Project on a local machine and then store the source code for that project in a GitHub repository.

Note that these instructions are repeatable, that is, they include instructions on deleting what was created so that you may repeat the instructions again - as many times as you want to.

***Note that specific userids, file names, and folder names are used - no attempt has been made to generalize: extrapolate as you need to.***

# Create a new GitHub Repository

- goto the GitHub website: https://github.com
- sign in to GitHub as `tcrook0`
- click `tcrook0` drop-down, in upper right corner
- click `Your repositories` link
- click `New` button, below `tcrook0` drop-down
- enter the following in `Repository name` field: `IntegratedProjects`
- click `Create repository` button, near bottom
- note the new window with the title `tcrook0/IntegratedProjects`, near top
- the new GitHub repository, `IntegratedProjects` has been created

# Clone the New Repository on Local Machine

Bring up a `Terminal` window and issue the following commands:

```
cd /Users/tomcrook/Documents/_ACME
git clone https://github.dom/5d4ook0/IntegratedProjects.git
```

Response to the above:

```
Cloning into 'IntegratedProjects'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository
```

Issue commands:

```
ls -al
ls -al .git
git status
git config --list
```

Response to the above indicates a new directory, the cloned repository `IntegratedProjects`, which is connected to the GItHub repository of the same name, has been created, consisting of one directory named `.git`.

# Create a New Java Eclipse Project in the Repository

From the `Terminal` window:

```
mkdir -p UCSCext/CMPR_X412/Week1
```

bring up `Eclipse`:

`Browse...` to the following `Workspace` (full path):

```
/Users/to crook/Documents/_ACME/IntegratedProjects/UCSCext/CMPR_X412/Week1
```

Note: from an `Eclipse` perspective, ...`/Week1` is the `Workspace`.

click `Launch` button

click `Hide` button

click `Create a Java Project` link, found in `Package Explorer`

enter the follwing in the `Project name` field: `Homework1`

near the bottom, turn off the following two checkboxes:
1. `Create module-info.java file`
2. `Generate comments`

click `Finish` button

This results in a new window with a blank editor field. Copy and paste the entire contents of the following file into this field (`Finder` works well for navigating to this file which may be opened by double-clicking on it):

```
Macintosh HD > Users > tomcrook > Documents > _ACME
             > EclipseJavaWorkSpaces 
             > USCSext
             > 2019_4thQtr_CMPR_X412.(21)_JavaProgrammingForBeginners
             > Week1
             > Homework1
             > src
             > Homework1.java
```

# Verify the Project Runs

From `Eclipse`:

- click `Run` drop-down from the menu bar, top.
- click `Run` (the first item in the drop-down menu)

A `Console` window should appear with output generated by the following new `Java Eclipse Project` just created:

`Homework1`

close `Eclipse`

# .gitignore

From `Terminal`, issue `ls -al` commands to explore the local `IntegratedProjects` directory/repository, revealing the following:

```
.../IntegratedProjects
  .DS_Store
  .git
  UCSCext
         .DS_Store
         CMPR_X412
                  .DS_STORE
                  Week1
                       .DS_Store
                       .gitignore
                       .metadata
                       Homework1
                                .DS_Store
                                .classpath
                                .gitignore
                                .project
                                .settings
                                bin
                                   Homework1.class
                                src
                                   Homework1.java
```

Note how this compares with what the directory/repository looked like before `Eclipse`:

```
.../IntegratedProjects
  .git
  UCSCext
         CMPR_X412
                  Week1
```

Creating the Java Eclipse Project `Homework1` generated a lot of new files! Only one of those new files is to be copied across the local/remote `GitHub` divide:

```
.../IntegratedProjects
  .git
  UCSCext
         CMPR_X412
                  Week1
                       Homework1
                                src
                                   Homework1.java
```

It would be nice to have a relatively easy way to prevent most of the files from being copied over...

One way to do this is to create a `.gitignore` file, directly under `.../IntegratedProjects` and therefore adjacent to both `.git` and `UCSCext`.

In this file, the names of files and directories to be excluded from being copied over are listed. There are many different ways this this `.gitignore` file may be written. Here's one way that works - type this into the `.gitignore` file:

```
.DS_Store
.classpath
.gitignore
.metadata
.project
.settings
bin
```

From `Terminal`:

```
git status
```

Response:

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        UCSCext

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

# add

From `Terminal`:

```
git add UCSCext
git status
```

Response:

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file: UCSCext/CMPR_X412/Week1/Homework1/src/Homework1.java
```

# commit

From `Terminal`:

```
git commit
```

This brings up the `vi` editor... Add the following to the `.../.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` file:

```
Commit the following Java Eclipse Project: Homework1.
```

From `Terminal`:

```
git status
```

Response:

```
On branch main
Your branch is based on 'origin/main', but the upstream is gone.
  (use "git branch --unset-upstream" to fixup)
  
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

# push

From `Terminal`:

```
git push
```

Response:

```

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

# Verify the Source Code for the Project is Now in GitHub

- to avoid any potential refresh issues, sign off from `GitHub` then sign back on
- click `tcrook0` drop-down, in the upper right corner
- click `Your repositories`
- find `IntegratedProjects` in the list of repositories displayed and click on it.

Not qute halfway down the page, to the right of `tcrook0`, the text entered earlier in the `.../.git/CFOMMIT_EDITMSG` file is displayed:

```
Commit the follwoing Java Eclipse Project: Homework1.
```

Click on this and hyou will see that the following file was copied over:

```
UCSCext/CMPR_X412/QWeek1/Homework1/src/Homework1.java
```

...and none of the other files were copied over - because of the .gitignore.

# Verify the Project Runs

# Delete the Repository on GitHub

# Delete the Cloned Local Repository
